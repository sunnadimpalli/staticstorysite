Summary: Jegatha discovers something disturbing in Ward No. 36.

14th Day of February, 2068.

Jegatha woke up with a start. She had fallen asleep within minutes of putting her head on her folded arms in one corner of the nursing station No. 2. She was on the 11th Floor of the Markham-Sheppard General Hospital and Research Centre that was located at the south west corner of the intersection Markham and Sheppard Avenues. She was allowed two breaks of 20 minutes each or one break of 35 minutes during her shift. She had chosen the 35 minutes break today. There was no one else in nursing station. It was usually the constantly ringing phone in the nursing station that woke her up, but today she blinked at the phone and it seemed silent. 

_Hmmm, that is strange, I thought I heard something._ 

She lifted her heard higher to see if there was any sound out of the ordinary that might have woken her up. She couldn't hear anything. She decided to try falling asleep again. Another minute went by without any auditory incident and then she heard it again. The sound was surely coming from far. The 11th floor primarily housed wards with patients under postoperative care, and because of that most of the patients were either heavily sedated or under high dosages of pain medication which caused drowsiness. So it was unusual for anyone to be screaming with pain on the 11th floor. 

She got up from the car, stretched, and walked out of the nursing station to locate the source of the sound. She could not hear it once she was out of the nursing station. She checked in on all the patients on north half of the floor which was the responsibility of the nursing station No. 2 and then she made her way over to the nursing station No. 1 that was responsible for the south half of the 11th floor. She saw Jenean Hampton at the computer writing up a report. She was using an older model GOB340 computer that needed a stylus with a wired connection to capture the hand writing of the nursing staff. The computer then converted the hand written text into a readable computer font. 

Jenean Hampton heard Jegatha's footsteps and before she could speak, said, "Jegatha girl, don't ask me anything right now, I need to finish this report within the next 20 minutes or else the sup is going be on my case". 

"I am not here to ask you a question", said Jegatha trying to sound innocent. 

"Uh huh".

"Sorry, I lied, I am here to ask you a question", blurted out Jegatha, "did you hear anyone screaming?" 

"I told you not to ask me any questions", said Jenean still not turning away from her report, "especially crazy ones like this." 

"Oh", said Jegatha with a question mark on her face, "I must be hearing things. Thanks Jenean, good luck with the report."

Jenean waved her good bye still not taking her eyes of her report. 

Jegatha went back to her nursing station and she could hear the screams getting louder. She wondered where the sound was coming from, then she remembered that sometimes she could hear sounds from the floor above her through the centralized AC ducts. 

Jegatha dialled there number of the nursing station on the 12th floor, but got no response. She had sometime left on her break so she decided to go up and investigate. She climbed up the stairs to the floor above and looked on either side on the stairs straining to hear any sounds. For a few seconds there was not sound then she heard a loud wail from the south side of the floor. She hurried towards the sound and followed the sound to Ward No. 36. She tried the door and went into the room to find a bed on the very end of the room curtained off. She peeped into find an old man with long hair struggling on the bed. He was shirt less and wore shorts issued by the hospital. His hands and legs were cuffed to the bed and there was no way he could get up. He had a dark shimmering patch on his stomach. 

Jegatha ran to his bed side and she checked if there were any charts at his bedside to give her more information about his condition. She also wanted to know who was the doctor treating this person so she could call the doctor over. There was a chart near the bed, but whatever was written on did not help Jegatha in anyway. 

> Test Subject: 398. 
> Test Procedure: A12
> Start Time: 02/14/2068 1600 
> End Time: 02/14/2068 1800

She quickly ran to the nearest nursing station to call Jenean to come up. Jenean did not respond as she had left the floor a minute ago to down to the lab on the 4th floor to collect a blood report. 

Jegatha ran back to the ward No. 36 and in an attempt to find out what she could from the person she said, "Hey mister, are you in pain, where is the pain? Who cuffed you to the bed? Do you know the name of your doctor?"

"Help.... pain..... dunno doctor..... help.... pain...."
