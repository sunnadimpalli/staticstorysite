She was allowed two breaks of 20 minutes each or one break of 35 minutes during her shift. She had chosen the 35 minutes break today. There was no one else in nursing station. It was usually the constantly ringing phone in the nursing station that woke her up, but today she blinked at the phone and it seemed silent.

She lifted her heard higher to see if there was any sound out of the ordinary that might have woken her up. She couldn't hear anything. She decided to try falling asleep again. Another minute went by without any auditory incident and then she heard it again. The sound was surely coming from far. The 11th floor primarily housed wards where patients were cared for immediately post surgery.
