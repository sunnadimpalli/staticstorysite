Series: Jegatha's Innocence
Summary: All is not what it seems to be. Jegatha reads an obituary, that raises more questions than answers.

Both Jegatha and Kajun looked at the looked at each other in surprise, a second ago Kajun had read out the message he had received from his supervisor that he was supposed to get to the Ward No. 36 on the 12th Floor for a cleanup. Then Jegatha asked with her eyes narrowed, "So you knew about this room and this man?" 

"No. I swear, I had no idea. My supervisor told me get to the 12th floor for a cleanup and he said that he will message me the room number in a minute. I picked up the stuff and got into the elevator and I never received anything while I was in the elevator, and then as soon as I came out of it, I ran into you, or rather you ran into me and this whole thing happened." 

Jegatha never trusted people easily and so it took a couple of seconds before her big eyes relaxed and a look of concern spread across her face. _Who was that man? Why was he in this floor? Why wasn't anyone with him to watch over him?_ It was protocol that even if there was one patient on any particular floor there had to be someone in the nursing station to provide immediate attention and care to the patients in case of such situations. 

"Ok, I believe you. Can you do me a favour and after you are done doing what you came here to do, can you ask your supervisor about this man and what happened to him? I am curious. You can find me in the 11th floor nursing station until 6 in the morning, the phone extension number is 203." said Jegatha to Kajun, she half turned to go, stopped, turned back, touched Kajun's arm spoke in a soft voice, "Please let me know what you find out and I will buy you a cup of green tea." 

"I will let you know what I find out, after all a green tea is at stake here", said Kajun smiling. He then watched Jegatha wave at him and walk away. Her shoes squeaked a few times while she was towards the stairs. 

Once back to her nursing station, the first thing she was that there light lights blinking against some of the room numbers on the patient monitoring screen in the station. Which meant the patients in those room were calling out for a nurse and the list of numbers were sorted in the order of the call being recieved. She quickly ran to the room number mentioned on the top of the list to attend to the calling patient. 

For the next three hours Jegatha was on her feet going from room to room attending to the calls and also making the scheduled visits to either administer medication or to observe and record a patient's condition. In between attending to patients she also answered phone calls coming in from various other departments and from doctors checking in on their paitents. 

The phone rang one more time and Susan Knight picked it up. Susan was working with Jegatha's assigned to the same nursing station and shared night shift's duties with Jegatha. She was a couple of years younger than Jegatha had started her career in nursing in after her studies in a small city called Medicine Hat in Alberta. She had studied the two year nursing program in the Medicine Hat College and was teased by everyone for it. She had over the years grown accustomed to it and now the teasing didn't even bother her. 

Susan listened to person speaking on the other side and said, "One moment please I will put Ms. Jegatha on, who do I say is calling?" She then heard the response and closed the mouth piece with her palm and turned towards Jegatha with a raised eyebrow. 

"A certain man named Kajun wants to talk to Ms. Jegatha, do you know any Ms. Jegatha's around here?" she asked Jegatha teasingly. 

"Just give me the phone", said Jegatha in mock anger taking the phone from Susan's hand.
