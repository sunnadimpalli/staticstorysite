Summary: Poornima discovers something new about herself.


The trip to Gomer's house had not helped her. Her anger did not subside. Her questions did not get answered and she felt like she was about to burst into tears.  

She did not what to say to Gomer and she had to leave that very minute. "I.....” she started, but words suddenly vanished from her mind. "I am leaving", was all that she managed to say and walked out of Gomer's apartment.  

She took the Metro to reach the office address she was given. The journey was forty five minutes long. She found an empty seat and slumped into it. As she sat there, tears started to roll down her face. She could not fathom why she felt sad. Although the train was crowded with people on their way to work, she felt so alone. She hugged herself and slumped down a little further. She wanted to shrink and turn invisible.  

She leaned forward and cupped her chin in her hands. Her elbows were on her knees. Tears continued to drop from her eyes for most of the journey.  
The journey felt like an eternity. She reached the given address. It was an ancient building and looked almost dilapidated. It had arched doorways. She stepped inside to find a glass door that opened inside automatically as she stepped towards it. Inside the door it was as if there was no relation to the building the way it looked from the outside. The decor was completely different than what she had expected to find by looking at the building from the outside.

The walls were bare but painted in a variety of shades of blue. The shades were symmetrical on either side of the door and started at the darkest shade of blue. Right opposite to the door on the other side of the room was a desk with a receptionist also wearing blue.  

She walked up to the desk and said, "Hi I am Poornima Manav. I am from the Metro Rail. I was asked to report here today".  

The receptionist looked up and smiled. "Hi I am Lisa", she said extending her hand, "welcome to the Human Design Center, let me find your contact". While Lisa was looking through her computer, Poorni noticed the letters HDC on the wall behind Lisa. The letters were painted in a subtly different shade of blue. It was almost imperceptible.  She wondered what was the point of using a color that was almost invisible.  

Lisa picked up her desk phone and dialed a number. "She is here", she said and hung up. "Can you wait here a few minutes? Your guide will be here soon".  

Poorni smiled and walked to the set of chairs that were located on one side of the desk. She did not sit; her mind was not relaxed enough to allow her to sit. Her emotions were still running high. She turned away from Lisa and stood facing the wall. A short while after, a girl almost Poorni's age walked into the room from inside the building. She was tall and looked lean. She was wearing shorts that ended above her knee. And a blue colored T-shirt that had HDC printed just above her left breast. "Hello! Poornima is it?” she asked offering her hand. 

She introduced herself and took Poornima to the design studio. She introduced Poornima to the rest of the team. The team explained to her what they expected from her. She was supposed to coach the members of the team on how to drive the standard metro train. They asked her many questions and Poornima did not have time even to think for the rest of the day. By the end of the day, Poornima was tired, her throat sore from all the talking and her legs aching as she had stood almost the whole time. It was only after she came out of the building that she realized that not a single depressing thought had crossed her mind the whole day. She did feel overwhelmed with all the attention and questions that she got that day and couldn’t wait to get back home.  

On the train journey back home she texted Gomer. "1 day done, 44 more to go! I hate you".  

The rest of the days of her assignment rolled by in a blur. Every day she would send the same message to Gomer with the day count. Every message would end with "I hate you". And every day Gomer would reply with a smiley to her text. At the end of her assignment she was sad that it was over. She had had a lot of fun with the designers. She had coached them and a couple of the designers had become expert at the simulator. They gave her a send off treat and she bid her goodbye with tears, hugs and pats on the back.  

On the way back home that day, she texted Gomer, "Finally done with the assignment. Can I buy you a coffee?” Gomer was not free that day and messaged her saying that the following Saturday would be good for the coffee. Saturday was two days away. Poorni was looking forward to it more than she expected and she woke up the Saturday morning with a warm feeling. She asked Gomer to come to the diner below her apartment. Gomer was on time and was already waiting for Poornima by the time she entered the diner. They both sat down a booth in a corner.
