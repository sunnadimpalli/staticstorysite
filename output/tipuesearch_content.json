Suraj worked as a financial analyst, and was on his way to become a team leader soon. Poorni admired Suraj's confidence in himself. When he walked into a room, people took notice. His walk had a certain majestic quality to it. He wielded his personal charm like a weapon and used it to break through to even the most reserved person in the room if he wanted to. He loved to show off how lucky he was with everything in life. He always felt invincible. And that was the night he had disappeared from her life. ----X----X----X---- Gomer had watched the train pull into the station when Poornima was driving it. He could see her face in the glow of the cabin light and he could see her face slowly turning sad as the train came to a halt. It was evident to him how much Poornima loved to drive. He thought that the driver's cabin was her dominion, and when she was on her shift she must feel that everything was manageable. It was like she was a different person in the cabin and a mere shadow of that person outside of it. He sensed how this fog of sadness took over her on her way away from the train station. He so much wanted to yank that soul crushing gloom from her person and burn it with a blow torch so all that would remain would be this happy beacon of a person that she was when inside the driver's cabin. Gomer had trained with her at the training academy for the metro train drivers. Poorni was was ranked very high in the in the selection exam and he had barely made it in. In fact, the only reason he got the job was because one of the trainees got charged with a DUI and thus deemed unqualified for this job. Gomer's observation was that, even though Poornima was not much of a talker, she was was very helpful to people who had questions about the work. She would go out of her way to guide someone or help them through a problem. He had got a lot of help from Poorni when they were classmates and it had helped him improve his scores a lot. She had made him feel special and his interest in the training program had spiked whenever he got help from Poorni. Everyone including himself had witnessed the joy that Poorni had felt when she was the first from their training class to be selected first for the job. It seemed as if that the biggest and the happiest thing that happened to her. And then Suraj came into her life. Poorni was happy as can be both professionally and personally. Suraj took her into his world. A world away from the demons that bothered Poornima. She moved in with him and and she could stay away from all the situations that brought her sadness. She was transported into completely different world when with him. One where she could forget her past and look happily into a bright future. Three months ago their relationship things took an undesirable turn when Suraj went away from Poornima's life. She took unapproved leave from work and did not emerge from the house for many days. She felt broken, fragile, lost. She felt like there was no tomorrow. Food tasted like saw dust. Social company felt like poison. Sunshine seemed like acid rain. She shut herself down in the house and refused to take any calls, answer emails or even knocks on the door. It took a lot of banging on the door and threatening to call the police, to get her to open the door. Gomer had finally got her to see another human being after 60 days. She looked like an apparition when she opened the door. It looked she had hardly eaten in those 60 days. The house smelled. She herself stank. Gomer had brought Monika with him along with another friend of hers. All three literally dragged her into the bath and the two girls bathed her while Gomer started cleaning the house. It took five days of repetition of this same routine for Poorni to grudgingly give in and agree to come back to work. Poorni' s boss was short staffed and had agreed to letter her back in only because Gomer and few other has threatened to quit if he did not give Poorni her job back. The driver's cabin beckoned her as a place of solace and contentment. She barely managed to follow the protocol the first day she was back. She kept breaking down into tears. But over the next few days, she remembered how great she felt being a competent train driver. It stopped her crying and even made her smile. When she was driving, she felt like it was the only time when Suraj's absence did not bother her so much. Because in there she was not a broken half but a confident whole self. She was not an incompetent failure but a competent achiever. Gomer used to keep track of her arrival times at the station near his house and sometimes used to come to the platform to just to wave her by. She was very thankful for what he had done, but was not completely ok with what he had done. The first thing that would hit her every time she saw Gomer was a wave of embarrassment. She felt like he had seen her insides. He had seen her ugly, shabby, crying self at a time when she was wallowing in self-pity. He had seen her when she was boney and dirty not having eaten properly or kept up her hygiene. He had no right to interfere with her life like. If she wanted to starve and vanish from this world, it was her choice and Gomer had no right to force her to change her plans. The past few weeks, Gomer use to text her to check on her, if she was doing ok and if she needed anything. She ignored the texts for most of the part and would reply on rare occasions. She felt it was right to ignore him. He had meddled with her life and she did not like it. The next day, as Poorni was getting ready for her shift, she heard a chime on her phone. She picked it up and found an email from her boss. The manufacturer of the city's metro trains was commissioned to redesign the coaches. The design department's staff wanted to collaborate with the train operating staff to get inputs for the new designs. The boss wanted her to spend three days every week with the manufacturer's design team starting today. She was furious that she had no say in this matter. Nobody asked her if she wanted to be part of the project. And the worst part was that this meant that she needed to be away from her driver's cabin three of days every week. She called her boss to explain to him that she was better suited in the driver's cabin. Her boss explained to her that the assignment was first offered to Gomer and he had recommended her name instead. And that her name was already passed to the higher ups. There was nothing he could do now and that she had to work on this project. \"This is it\", she screamed in her mind. She quickly put on her uniform and stormed out of the house. She hailed a cab and ask him to hurry to 21, Boston Ave. She arrived at the address 20 minutes later. She looked up at the top floor of the building. Gomer lived in the apartment on the top floor. Her fist was closed tight into a ball as she struggled hard to hold all her anger within herself. She ran up the flights of stairs and was banging on Gomer's door with her clenched fist. Her anger was taking toll on the door. The door number that was stuck on the door fell off.","tags":"Poornima's Predicament","url":"/discontent.html"},{"title":"Poornima's Predicament - Chapter 2 - Pockets of Pleasure","text":"Standing there, tall and shiny in her pressed uniform and hat, she was causing quite a few heads to turn. She paid no attention to them and waited for her train. At exactly 1 minute past 9.00 AM, the train swept into the platform and stopped very close to where she was standing. The passenger doors opened and people began rushing out. Then people waiting on the platform rushed in. And then the driver's door opened too and the biggest guy in their division Big Mac stomped out carrying his lunch bag. \"All yours Poorni\", he said waving as he walked past her. She liked Big Mac and put a high five on his hand before it dropped. \"Thanks Mac, sleep well\", she said. She got into the driver's cabin and locked it first. She put her bag in the driver's locker and sat down on the seat. The pressure sensor in the seat detected her and turned on the touch screen console in front of her. She entered her driver passcode and then the console blinked to reveal the driving controls. She ensured that all the doors were closed and started moving the speed controller fader on the screen to get the train moving. Thus began her work day. Poornima Manav was Level 2 Train Pilot for the city Metro. As the train picked up speed, Poornima's lips elongated into a beautiful smile. This smile appeared almost every day without fail. She loved driving trains. And it was way cooler than she had imagined when she was young girl. The 8 hour driving shift with a 30 minute lunch break required her to stay alert all the time. Her years of experience in the job had made her highly skilled and had honed her senses that she could detect the tiniest of the anomalies in the sounds that reached her in the driver's cabin. Poornima's felt her most confident self when inside the driver's cabin. She made decisions boldly, she was confident about her interpretations of the sounds and sights that greeted her while in control of the train. She felt like she was a completely different (if not, a better) person when she was inside the cabin. Her shift was about to close, so she used the driver change notification button on her console so that the next shift driver can be ready at her drop off station. She got off at the same station she had got on in the morning. Gomer Henderson was her handover driver. As she pulled in the station, hear eyes searched for the familiar figure of Gomer leaning against the wall. She collected her things and with a longing sigh, gave one last look for the day at the console and left the cabin. \"Hi Gomer\", she said as she walked by. \"Howdy\", grunted Gomer. Gomer watched her walk by and disappear around the corner of the hallway. He then walked to the driver's cabin with a whistle. With every step that Poorni took walking away from the train station, it felt to her like a gloom was enveloping her. Her shoes made a crunching sound every time it hit the ground. And she felt like every crunch was telling her something. Crunch. \"You should work hard\". Crunch. \"Look at your colleagues, they are so much better at their job than you\". Crunch. \"Your high school friend Mary, is working as a Manager and has two kids, why aren't thinking about settling down yet\". Crunch. \"If you had studied harder in school, you might have become manager too\". Crunch. Crunch. Crunch... Everything that she had heard growing up, came back to her as it had always done. Her smile had long vanished. She hung her head down and walked to her apartment. She knew the only way to shake these voices were to go running. Once she was in her apartment, before the day's fatigue overtook her, she got in to her running clothes and literally ran out of her apartment. The park where she usually ran was nearby and she forcefully filled her head with a single thought. \"Run Poorni, run Poorni, run Poorni....\". So said this to her so much so that she was running the moment her foot touched the park ground. She ran till she was drenched in sweat. She came back home tired but in a better mood. She quickly fixed herself a meal and hit the bed. She could feel her eyes feeling heavy and slowly dropping down. She never used to have trouble sleeping up until that fateful day three months ago.","tags":"Poornima's Predicament","url":"/pockets-of-pleasure.html"},{"title":"Poornima's Predicament - Chapter 1 - Daily Grind","text":"Her feet were dragging on the paved walking path of the park instead of running on them. It was a beautiful park, but Poornima was in no mood to run today. There were heavy thoughts on her mind. She hated feeling sad, but that was what she was right now, sad. She took a big breath of air and decided to give running another shot. \"Come on Poorni, come on Poorni, come on Poorni, RUUUUUN\", she thought to herself and broke into a jog. It felt good. It always felt good to run. She loved it. She continued to run all around the one and half mile loop. Once, then once more and then once more. By the end of the third time her face was flush with blood, it felt hot. She sucked in another deep breath and ran the fastest toward completing the third and final round. She was panting heavily by the time she stopped. Sweat was dripping off her nose. It was getting into her eyes. She took out the small towel that she had brought with her and wiped her face dry. The first thing that she noticed as the evening's breeze blew past her face, was that she was no longer sad. \"Yessssss\", she said to herself. \"Fuck you Suraj\", she screamed in her mind. She walked to her car and picked up her phone to choose where she wanted to have dinner. She chose a place that she frequented and had an open air seating. It was fall and it was a pleasant day to sit outside and eat. After finishing her meal, she drove to her apartment, got into the shower and got into bed wearing a long T-shirt. She sent an IM to her running pal Monica that she ran four and half miles today. Poornima was still holding the phone when the phone chimed and she received an IM back from Monica. \"• 5 miles\" She wrinkled her nose and sent a emoji back that looked like a pair of clapping hands. \"I have got to beat this girl tomorrow\", she thought. She put her phone on the bed stand and turned off the light. The room did not go completely dark, the window in the room was streaming in light from the street light outside. Sleep came to her quickly and like always she never heard her barely audible snoring. Slowly the intensity of the light coming from the streetlight in her room was growing. It became brighter and brighter so much so that she could feel the heat from the light on her closed eyelids. She opened her eyes to find a form standing facing her with its back to the window. The intense light was everywhere and except the silhouette which was darker than the night. The form stepped forward and she saw that it was Suraj. He was not wearing a shirt. Suraj extended his hand to her and before she knew what she was doing she had placed her hand in his. Suraj tugged on her hand gently and she gladly got off the bed into his embrace. The light started to dim and its intensity faded to that of a sunset. She raised her arms and put them around Suraj's neck as he pulled her close. Poornima laid her head on his shoulder, her face towards him. There was a melodious music playing in the background. Suraj started to sway his hips to the music and Poornima couldn't stop herself from moving along with his hips. Suraj started gracefully sliding his feet on the floor and with each move was pulling Poornima closer and closer. He put his hands in her shirt and started caressing her back. She felt the caress so relaxing that she nestled even closer to him. She got on her toes and started kissing his neck. His hands were now roaming over her curvy bottom. His right hand moved to her bosom. Poornima's breathe quickened and she put one of her legs around his hips. While she was clinging to him, he moved his other hand to her groin and started gently squeezing her down there. She was fully aroused now and could not wait for Suraj to enter her. \"Fuck me Suraj\", she whispered in his ear. He continued to caress her breasts and his fingers started to move deeper into her. \"Take me now Suraj, I need you. I need you now\", she said huskily. His fingers were deep in her and were thrusting rhythmically. She was going crazy and could not take it anymore. She held him tight and started saying \"Fuck me now, Suraj\". He called out her name. \"Hmmm\", she moaned. \"Poornima\", said Suraj even louder. \"What?\" she said half moaning with pleasure. \"Poornima, Poornima, Poornima, poo, poo, poo, beep, beep, beep, beep\". Her eyes opened and she found her hands inside her t-shirt, one hand caressing her breast, and the other deep inside herself, it was the alarm that was beeping. \"Shit\" she cursed \"I hate you Suraj\" she said and was about to get up. She paused and then decided to not let her arousal go to waste. She continued pleasure herself until her head raised off the pillow, her back arched and her toes splayed in an uncontrolled spasm caused by her early morning orgasm. Slowly her body stopped throbbing and she rested her head back on the pillow and closed her eyes for what felt like an instant. She opened her eyes and saw the clock, 20 mins had gone by. She got up quickly and showered. She put on her uniform and headed down to the diner that was under her apartment. Rather her apartment was above the said diner. She went and called out to Julio who was the chef cum land lord. He did not need to work as a chef in his own diner but he loved the cooking and excitement of working in a kitchen. \"The usual please Julio\", said Poornima. \"Coming right up Poorni\", yelled Julio back. \"You look bright\", he added. Poornima blushed a crimson red. \"Yup\", was all that came out of her mouth. She had a tab at the Eggz Palace as it was called, and when her scrambled eggs, well done, with a side of potatoes came, she pounced on it. The plate was empty in no time. She yelled thanks to Julio and walked out of the place toward the nearest metro station. She took the escalator down to the platform and watched as people scanned their smart cards to go through the gates that lead to the platform. She scanned her own card and went through them. She was early and her train was not due for another 9 minutes. She stood at one end of the platform and waited for the train.","tags":"Poornima's Predicament","url":"/the-daily-grind.html"}]}
